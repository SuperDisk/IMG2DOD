I wrote this tool to read an image, then click various buttons on the screen and draw up (pixel-by-pixel)
an image on the Doodle or Die canvas. It's really quite silly and the images come out as posterized messes,
so you're probably not going to be impressing anyone by doing this.

Oh well. It was fun to make.

You need to change the screen coordinates of the mouseclicks in the dictionary for it to work on your computer.
I've got it calibrated to mine, but it probably won't work on yours.
